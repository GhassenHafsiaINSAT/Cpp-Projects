# Modern C++ Programming

## C++ Type System

C++ organizes language types into two main categories:

- **Fundamental types**: Types provided by the language itself.
  - Arithmetic types: integer and floating point.
  - `void`
  - `nullptr`

- **Compound types**: Compositions or references to other types.
  - Pointers
  - References
  - Enumerators
  - Class Enumerators *(added in C++11 Standard)*
  - Arrays
  - `struct`, `class`, `union` *(or, since C++17, the type-safe alternative: `std::variant`)*
  - Functions
  - Lambdas

## Conversion Rules

`*` : any operation.

- **Floating Point Promotion**: floating type * integer type = floating type.
- **Implicit Integer Promotion**: small_integral_type * small_integral_type = int.
- **Size Promotion**: small_type * large_type = large_type.
- **Sign Promotion**: signed_type * unsigned_type = unsigned_type.
- **Implicit Promotion**: +a / a+0 = ASCII code.

## `auto` Keyword

- Specifies that the compiler will automatically deduce the type of the variable.
- `auto` can be useful for maintainability and hiding complex type definitions.
- `auto` and `decltype` can be used to deduce the return type based on an expression.

- The `auto` keyword was reintroduced in C++11 to simplify type declarations. In earlier versions of C++, `auto` was used to indicate automatic storage duration, which was the default and rarely explicitly stated. The modern usage allows for type inference, making code more concise and maintainable.

## C++ Operators

```cpp
enum color_t {BLACK, BLUE, GREEN};
color_t color = BLUE;
```

## Class Enumerators

A class enumerator `enum class` is a data type added in the **C++11 Standard**. They are also known as **scoped enumerations**. They are type-safe and strongly scoped:

- **Type Safe:** They do not allow implicit conversions to int, similar to how `nullptr` does not allow conversion to 0, and do not allow comparisons with other enumerations, thus solving many type-related problems and potential bugs in code.
- **Strongly Scoped:** They do not cause variable naming problems.

```cpp
//Here is an example of an enum class

// Declaration
enum class EnumName { Value1, Value2, ValueN };

// Initialization
EnumName objectName = EnumName::Value1;

// Declaration
enum class Color { Red, Green, Blue };

// Initialization
Color col = Color::Red;
```

## Enumerators vs Class Enumerators

- Classic C-enum pitfalls:

  - Enums are named integer constants, so comparison with integers and other enums is allowed and doesn't cause compilation problems, but it can be overlooked in development and cause issues.
  - Different enum values can't have the same name. For example, you can't have an enum value of ERROR in both the `Networking_Result` enum and the `Parsing_Result` enum. Additionally, a variable called ERROR will cause a compilation error even if it has nothing to do with the enum.

- **C++11** introduced class enumerators to solve these pitfalls. This enhancement was part of the broader effort in C++11 to improve type safety and modernize the language.

## Unions

- A `union` is a structure where data members share the same memory space, meaning at any given time, a union can contain no more than one object from its list of members. It always uses only enough memory to store the largest member.

- A `union` can be used for:

- Saving memory space by allowing two data members that are never used at the same time to share the same piece of memory. Example:

```cpp
void F1(int x[]); // F1 changes the content of x.
void F2(float x[]); // F2 changes the content of x.
void F3(bool y) {
  int a[1000];
  float b[1000];
  if (y) {  
    F1(a);
  }
  else {
    F2(b);
  }
  // do something else
}
```

- This can be rewritten as:

```cpp
void F1(int x[]); // F1 changes the content of x.
void F2(float x[]); // F2 changes the content of x.
void F3(bool y) {
  union { 
    int a[1000]; 
    float b[1000]; 
  }; 
  if (y) { 
    F1(a); 
  } 
  else { 
    F2(b); 
  }
  // do something else
}
```

- Using this method is perfect for large data that is not used simultaneously. It saves memory and reduces cache misses because the same memory will be used more often.

- Accessing the same data in different ways. Example:

```cpp
union { 
  float f; 
  int i; 
} x; 
x.f = 2.0f; 
x.i |= 0x80000000;  // set sign bit of f 
cout << x.f;        // will give -2.0 
```

- In this example, the sign bit of `f` is set using the bitwise OR operator, which can only be applied to integers.

**Note:** Unions can be a source of bugs. Ensure proper maintenance and access the same member you assigned. If any member types have a nontrivial constructor, you must write code to explicitly construct and destroy that member.

## `struct` vs `union`

- A `struct` groups different variables into a single unit, each variable having its location in memory.
- A `union` groups different variables in the same memory location.

In a nutshell:

- The size of a `struct` is the sum of the size of all its members plus padding (for efficiency and performance).
- The size of a `union` is the size of its largest member.

## `std::variant`

- At its core, `std::variant` is a union of types. It can store one value at a time from a predefined set of types. Unlike a traditional `union`, `std::variant` keeps track of its active type, ensuring correct value access.

### Examples for `std::variant`

- `std::variant` allows you to store one value from a set of predefined types and keeps track of the active type:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <variant>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::variant<int, float, std::string> v;
    v = 42;
    std::cout << std::get<int>(v) << std::endl;  // Outputs: 42

    v = 3.14f;
    std::cout << std::get<float>(v) << std::endl;  // Outputs: 3.14

    v = "hello";
    std::cout << std::get<std::string>(v) << std::endl;  // Outputs: hello

    return 0;
}
```

## Lambda Functions

- Lambda functions were introduced in C++11. Inspired by functional programming languages like Lisp, Haskell, and OCaml, they provide a practical way of defining closures (anonymous function objects that can be passed as arguments to functions or defined and invoked directly).

- Lambdas are syntactic sugar over function pointers and allow for higher-order functions, such as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` in JavaScript, enabling cleaner code.

- Typically, lambdas are used to encapsulate a few lines of code that are passed to algorithms or asynchronous functions. They can access variables from the enclosing scope in three ways:

  - Capture by reference.
  - Capture by value.
  - Capture by both (mixed capture).

- Syntax for capturing variables:
  
  - `[&]`: capture all external variables by reference.
  - `[=]`: capture all external variables by value.
  - `[a, &b]`: capture `a` by value and `b` by reference.

- A lambda with an empty capture clause `[ ]` can only access variables that are local to it.

### Examples of Lambda Functions

Lambdas can be used in various ways, such as encapsulating code passed to algorithms:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Capture by value
    std::for_each(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), [=](int n) {
        std::cout << n * n << " ";
    });
    std::cout << std::endl;  // Outputs: 1 4 9 16 25

    // Capture by reference
    int total = 0;
    std::for_each(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), [&](int n) {
        total += n;
    });
    std::cout << "Total: " << total << std::endl;  // Outputs: Total: 15

    return 0;
}
```

## Memory Segments in C/C++

![image](../memory.png)

### Stack Memory

- **Characteristics**:
  - Small memory, Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure.
  - Allocation at compile-time.
  - Each thread has its own stack.
  - Local variables and function arguments reside here.
  - Objects inside the stack are valid only within their scope.

```cpp
int main() {
    int A[] = {1, 2, 3}; // Example of stack memory usage
}
```

### Heap (Dynamic Memory)

- **Characteristics**:
  - Larger memory area compared to stack.
  - Allocation at run-time using new (C++) or malloc (C).
  - Relies on virtual memory.
  - Memory is shared among threads.

```cpp
// Dynamic memory allocation examples

// C style allocation and deallocation
int* value = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
free(value);

// C++ style allocation and deallocation
int* value = new int;
delete value;

// Array allocation and deallocation
int* array1 = (int*)malloc(4 * sizeof(int));
free(array1);

int* array2 = new int[4];
delete[] array2;

// Initialization with zero
int* array3 = (int*)calloc(4, sizeof(int));

int* array4 = new int[4](); // Note the parentheses in C++
```

- Each object allocated with malloc() must be deallocated with free().
- Each object allocated with new must be deallocated with delete.  

### BSS and Data segment

- **Characteristics**:

  - .bss and .data segments hold global and static global data.
  - Larger than stack memory but slower access.

```cpp
// Examples of data segment usage
int data[] = {1, 2}; // Data segment memory
int big_data[10000000] = {}; // BSS segment memory
```

### Code Segment (.text)

- **Characteristics**:
  - Contains the actual executable code.
  - Typically read-only in modern systems.

## Memory Leak

- A memory leak is a dynamically allocated entity in the heap memory that is no longer used by the program, but still maintained overall its execution

```cpp
int main() {
int* array = new int[10];
array = nullptr; // memory leak!!
}
```

## Pointers and references

### Pointer

- **Pointer** T* is a value referring to a location in memory

- **Pointer Dereferencing** (*ptr) is obtaining the value stored in at the location referred to the pointer.  

```cpp
int* ptr1 = new int;
*ptr1 = 4; // dereferencing (assignment)
int a = *ptr1; // dereferencing (get value)
```

- **Subscript Operator** [] allows accessing the pointer element at a given position.  

```cpp
int* ptr2 = new int[10];
ptr2[2] = 3;
```

- **Pointer arithmetic rule** : address(ptr + i) = address(ptr) + (sizeof(T) * i)

- The **address-of operator** & returns the address of a variable.  

```cpp
int a = 3;
int* b = &a;
```

- The arrow operator (->) is used with a pointer to an object

```cpp
A* ptr = &a;
ptr->x;
```

### References

- Avariable reference T& is an alias, namely another name for an existing variable.

- A pointer has its own memory address, reference shares the same memory address with the original variable.

- Not like pointers, references cannot have NULL value, cannot be changed and must be initalized when they are created.  

```cpp
int c = 2;
int& d = c; 
```

- The dot (.) operator is applied to local objects and references

```cpp
A& ref = a; 
ref.x; 
```
